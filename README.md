# Monopoly


This console-based implementation of Monopoly was written over the course of my second week as a Development Intern at Hyland Software
during the summer of 2019 and served as a platform for me to become comfortable with C#, Atlassian tools, source control, agile
development, and object-oriented programming before beginning my [main project integrating smart speakers, voice recognition, and NLP into Astra,
Hylandâ€™s healthcare content management application.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewmcdonald27/) 


Because of the time constraints and my lack of experience in object-oriented design at the time of implementation, I'll admit that this is not
my most polished work; nonetheless, I wanted to upload it here as a manifestation of my love for programming, problem-solving, challenge, learning,
and growth. I've come a long way since cobbling together this project, and see code design from a totally different perspective armed with the lenses
of unit-testability, division of responsibility, and scalability; we all start somewhere.


Feel free to download, build, and play the project against yourself or a friend, check out the Powerpoint describing the project architecture,
and shoot me an [email](mcdon499@msu.edu) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewmcdonald27/) message if you'd like to talk!


Enjoy!
